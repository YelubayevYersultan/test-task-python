# Test Task Solution

This repository contains a solution for a basic programming test task implemented in **two languages**:

1. **Python** — my main language
2. **JavaScript** — my second language that I am currently learning

## 📝 Task Description

The program performs the following tasks:

1. If the entered number is greater than 7, it prints "Hello".
2. If the entered name is "John", it prints "Hello, John". Otherwise, it prints "There is no such name".
3. Accepts a numeric array as input and outputs elements that are multiples of 3.
